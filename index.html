        <ul>
          <li>14 ounces coleslaw mix</li>

          <li>6 green onions, thinly sliced</li>

          <li>1/4 cup cilantro leaves, chopped</li>

          <li>1/4 cup seasoned rice vinegar</li>

          <li>1 1/2 tablespoons sesame oil</li>

          <li>1 tablespoon Sriracha, or more to taste</li>

          <li>1 1/2 teaspoons soy sauce</li>

          <li>1 teaspoon black sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>

        <div id="dir">
          <p id="tit">Directions</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Add coleslaw mix, green onions, and cilantro to a bowl. Whisk rice
              vinegar, 1 1/2 tablespoons sesame oil, 1 tablespoon Sriracha, 1
              1/2 teaspoons soy sauce, and 1 teaspoon sesame seeds together in a
              cup. Pour dressing over slaw and toss to coat. Set aside to
              marinate, tossing occasionally, at least 30 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
              Whisk water, hoisin sauce, 1 tablespoon Sriracha, fish sauce, and
              2 teaspoons sesame oil together in a large bowl; set aside.
            </li>

            <li>
              Heat a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir pork in the
              hot skillet with a generous pinch Kosher salt, breaking up pork
              with a spatula, until browned and crumbly and fat has rendered, 8
              to 10 minutes. Remove pork to the bowl with water-hoisin sauce
              mixture.
            </li>

            <li>
              Pulse mushroom pieces in a food processor until the size of green
              peas, 8 to 10 times. Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in the same skillet
              over medium heat. Cook and stir mushrooms with a generous pinch of
              salt until liquid has evaporated and mushrooms are beginning to
              turn golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer mushrooms to the bowl
              with pork.
            </li>

            <li>
              Meanwhile, pulse onion chunks, bell pepper chunks, and jalape√±o
              together in the food processor until vegetable mixture resembles
              pico de gallo, about 15 times.
            </li>

            <li>
              Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in the pan. Add onion mixture and a
              pinch of salt and cook until onions are translucent and most of
              the liquid has evaporated, 5 to 7 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
              Process garlic cloves in the food processor until small enough
              that all the bits are sticking to the sides, about 10 seconds.
              Stir garlic and ginger paste into the skillet with onion mixture
              and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Return meat and
              mushroom mixture to the skillet. Stir to combine; simmer until
              meat is coated in a thick sauce and most liquid has evaporated, 10
              to 12 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
              Mix mayonnaise and sesame oil in a small bowl. Spread a thin coat
              of mayonnaise mixture inside of both top and bottom buns. Add to a
              nonstick pan and toast over medium heat until golden, about 2
              minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
              Top prepared buns with sloppy joe mix, coleslaw, cilantro leaves,
              and a drizzle of Sriracha. Top with the other bun half.
            </li>
